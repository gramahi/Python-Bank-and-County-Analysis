# Python Bank and County Analysis

In this project, our main objective is to analyze a Bank's financials as well as a County's voting poll. Throughout this project we will we be relying on the power of python to write scripts that will retrieve our analytical points. We will also apply a second script to help conclude a poll set up for a county election.
